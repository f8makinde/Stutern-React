5)What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them
Answer:
i)One of the major differences between HTML and JSX is that in JSX, you must return a single parent element, or it won't compile.In HTML, you are free to do whatever you want as you don’t have to return a single parent element.
